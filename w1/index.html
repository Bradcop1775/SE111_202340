        <p>&emsp;Hello, my name is Bradley! I served in the United States Marine Corps for two years. 
        I was also a first responder both pre and post Covid. 
        I am a Cyber Security student at NEIT. 
        I hope that I will be able to complete my degree quick and retain as much as possible.

            <h2><b>Review</b> of <em>Battleship</em></h2>

            <p><b>Bradley Coppinger</b> review on <i>August 10, 2023</i></p>
            <p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>

            <p>If you are looking for an action-pact movie, look no further. This is by far one of the best "alien invasion" movies to date.
                It brings in a sense of realism, and how I think the Navy would actually react to an alien response such as this.
                The charatcrs provide a great sense of humor, and play their roles very well. The CGI is also worth note; as it is very complex and life like for a movie filmed in 2012.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As far as negatives go, I only have a few. Sometimes the actors break characters and its easy to tell you are watching a film. However, 
                many of them make up for this and you are right back in the action. This film also adds a love story that is followe dthroughout; which
                does appeal to a wider audience. This does fit the film and is nicley done.
            </p>

            <p>Overall, for the genre of the movie and style, I award this film a 5/5. I only wish they did not cancel the 
                <em>Battleship 2</em>. I feel like with streaming services being so accessible, it is easy for eveyrone to watch
                and fall in live with this film. I only hope in the future Hollywood can take advantage from this wonderful production and put it forward to other projects.
            </p>
